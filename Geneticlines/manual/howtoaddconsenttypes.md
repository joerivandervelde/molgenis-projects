# USER MANUAL â€“ HOW TO SET CONSENT INFORMATION MANUALLY

This manual explains how to update "Individual consent" in [Geneticlines](https://geneticlines.molgeniscloud.org). Each patient has signed a consent to participate in Geneticlines. In this consent, the participant specifies where which consent type(s) they choose. There are four types of consent, namely;  
- "Consent to request additional data (questionnaire)",
- "Consent to get data from Basic Registration Persons",
- "Consent to get additional information from CBS, LBZ, PALGA, other biobanks",
- "Consent re-contact on incidental findings"

A participant can choose which one or all consent types they want to consent to.

# 1. How to update consent type
At first, users need to have permission to update "Individual consent" information. Contact Geneticlines administration if you don't have "edit" rights for the "Individual consent" table.

1. In menu-bar "Consent" is shown, press menu-item.![menubar](/Geneticlines/images/consent_menu.png)
2. The "Individual consent" table opens.
3. If you have a specific participant that needs updating their consent, use the search bar. In the left corner, there is a search box stating "Search data values". Type or copy Geneticlines participation number in the search box and use the magnifying glass to search. ![searchbox](/Geneticlines/images/searchbox.png)
